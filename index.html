          <h2 class="mb-5">Thesis</h2>
          <p>For his Master’s thesis, Mr. Khoury-Diaz developed an ordinary least square (OLS) analysis while interpreting three models.  He completed research, developed hypotheses, managed and cleaned data, developed validation techniques during model selection, and tested for various lacks of fit.  He used publicly-available, individual-based economic data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) which is the longest running longitudinal household survey in the world. The dataset used in this study from 2013 was collected in 2012 and interviewed 9,063 families with a total of 4,257 variables.

          <p>By running a series of models using two income-specific dependent variables, his study explored the effects of independent variables on income earners for year 2012. Based on the University of Michigan’s PSID, the analysis interpreted several variables aimed at providing descriptive analysis. The variables included years of education, health status (at various levels) and whether your job requires a computer, if you took a vacation, commuting time, wealth and expenses related variables, such as, student loan, mortgages, credit/store card debt, medical bills, legal bills, loans from relatives, other debts, checking and saving accounts, contributions to your work pension, whether you cashed your pension, stock ownership, and bonds and insurance ownership. The computation of these models resulted in limited explanations of powers. Using the best model in the analysis, however, the results to the hypothesis are as follows:</p>

          <p>Hypothesis 1: In a comparison of income attained in one year, the use of discretionary time is correlated with a higher salary than those without discretionary time.</p>

          <p>Result: The use of discretionary time in this study meant taking a vacation, which was positively correlated to an increase in salary.</p>

          <p>Hypothesis 2: In a comparison of income generated in one year, those that have good health status and gain more years of education will have a higher salary than those who have bad health status and less educational degrees.</p>
          
          <p>Result: The effects of health status and years of education variables on salary failed to gain significance.</p>

          <p>Hypothesis 3: In a comparison of income attained in one year, those with savings and no debt will have a higher salary than those who have little or no savings and debt.</p>
          
          <p>Result: Two of the twelve variables received significance in the wealth and debt categories. The two significant variables suggest that those with savings and no debt have higher salaries. However, ten variables received no significance and therefore the results are limited.</p>

          <p>These results demonstrate how several variables can affect your earnings. Vacation, which is an expression of discretionary time, is a significant indicator of having more wealth. Education is not standalone in impacting salary. Other variables impact salary, but further research is necessary to determine what they are. Savings and debt are an indicator of labor income. Outstanding debts have a negative effect on your salary and having more savings positively impacts your salary. If you are in debt, even for a student loan, your salary is negatively affected. In fact, moving between economic brackets does not require an education if an education requires attaining debt. Loans ultimately have a lower effect on salary and can make it more challenging to paying that loan. This is not an endorsement to abstain from higher education.</p>

          <p>Khoury-Diaz’s research concludes that next steps should include various research models that delve beyond the PSID survey, potentially with data that provides variables with psychological effects.</p>

          <p>Life is joy and joy is life! Pedro is a happy person and what makes him happy is eating, working out and learning new things. He usually tries to do all three things, but not at once.</p>

          <p>Because he likes to eat, Pedro enjoys cooking, baking and gardening. If he owned more land, he would love to raise chickens, ducks and cattle organically.</p>

          <p>The gym is his haven. Being physical is thearaputic. Recently, he recovered from a 3 year back injury and he's celebrating with workouts six days a week.</p>

          <p>In conclusion, what he loves about data science is that the field is evolving and to keep up to date you constantly have to learn. This year, he learned to do programming and analytics in Python, built his own website, and learned how to scrape data from the internet. He doesn't know what he will be doing in 6 months, but whatever it is, he's already excited to tackle it.</p>
